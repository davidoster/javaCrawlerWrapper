javaCrawlerWrapper
==================

This java project consists of a crawler4j architecture crawler that crawls various sites:

-last.fm to retrieve 10k artists pages 
-kayak.it to retrieve 10k hotel pages
-ign.com to retrieve 10k games pages
-imdb.com to retrieve 10k movies pages

For each of these datasets, the wanted pages are locally saved with an increasing id and interesting fields (like band name, albums list for artists dataset) are stored in a csv file.
